Simple web app (C#)
=======================

Before running the application, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- .NET SDK (version 9.0 or higher)
- Docker (optional for containerization)


How to run
==========

1. Go to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AppWeather
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build AppWeather.csproj
   ```
3. After a successful build, run the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

Once the application is running, you can open a web browser and navigate to the URL specified in the terminal (usually something like http://localhost:5000) to see the web app in action.
